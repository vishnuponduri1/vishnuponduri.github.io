 ### Airbnb superhost criteria evaluation
 
 This Airbnb-focused project delves into critical business challenges to enhance decision-making for both hosts and the platform. The evaluation of Airbnb's 
 superhost status reveals that the current criteria show limited impact on bookings, prompting a proposal for restructuring to provide tangible monetary benefits 
 and boost overall platform bookings. Additionally, a tract-level analysis identifies factors influencing average bookings, with a focus on the number of hosts in 
 a tract and superhost-related interactions. The project suggests revising the superhost system alongside data-driven strategies to empower hosts, aiming for a 
 more lucrative and efficient platform while ensuring an improved and reliable service for Airbnb guests.

 ### Database development for a app - Darshan
 
 In the ever-evolving landscape of spiritual devotion, the Darshan App serves as a guiding beacon for India's spiritually inclined population. However, hindered by 
 its reliance on a legacy Microsoft Excel database, the app seeks a transformative upgrade through this project. The goal is to develop a sophisticated database 
 that efficiently manages Darshan's diverse resources, transcending the limitations of its current system. This upgrade promises an enriched user experience, 
 improved SEO, and innovative features like a festival calendar. The accompanying Entity-Relationship Diagram visualizes the intricate connections within the 
 database, ensuring precision and reliability. This project marks a crucial stride in Darshan's evolution, ushering in a modern database infrastructure to elevate 
 the spiritual journey for users.

 ### Sas optimisation for designing a balanced set of questions
 
 This project aims to optimize the creation of two sets of 50-question papers for a professor, adhering to specific constraints. With 308 decision variables and 
 various constraints, the objective is to minimize the difference in easiness between the two sets while considering historical correctness percentages. 
 Linearization techniques are employed for solvability, and assumptions include correlating low correctness with higher difficulty. The output provides the 
 professor with well-balanced question papers, enhancing the potential for automated computerized exams in the future.

 ### Machine learning techniques to minimise tunnel overbreak (common tunnelling problem)

 The project focuses on analyzing and optimizing overbreak issues in drill and blast tunneling at a live site, RVNL Package 2 in Rishikesh. Utilizing Rock 
 Engineering Solution (RES), we developed an Overbreak Index and a predicting model validated on site data. Control blasting techniques, such as smooth blasting 
 and pre-splitting, were applied, resulting in a 4% to 13% reduction in overbreak. The study also considered factors like delay time, advancement factor, and 
 confinement factor, providing valuable insights for risk mitigation and improved tunneling practices

 ### health insurance pricing and risk analysis
 
 This health insurance cost analysis project delves into three datasets—Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction, US Health Insurance, and Region-wise Obesity 
 Prevalence—to provide insights for insurance providers. The data story covers BMI sensitivity, state-wise patterns, and exploratory health analysis. Key concepts 
 include BMI distribution, color-coded gender-based BMI analysis, state-wise heatmaps, and average claims comparison. Recommendations focus on gender-based 
 pricing, lifestyle encouragement, diabetes impact assessment, and region-specific policies. Despite dataset limitations, the project offers strategic insights for 
 refining insurance strategies and promoting healthier living.
